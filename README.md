The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party.  What a strange typing test sentence...sounds like a communist call to action. Not that there's anything wrong with that.

Does that show my age? That I know those sentences as typing tests? Not me, my fathers. I don't remember my typing tests, only that my typing instructor, on a fleet of Apple IIe machines started to rub my classmate's chest when he named his homework files "hot" and "worked_up" and so on.  She was a disturbing individual.
